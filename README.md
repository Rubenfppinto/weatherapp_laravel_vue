# **Weather App**

## **Aim**

The aim was to build a plataform where the users could check the weather for the current day in a specific city. This app also provides information such as pressure, wind speed and humidity.

This was a learning project for myself to get familiar with using VueJS as a front end in a Laravel and connect to an external API.

## **How to access the application:**
https://weatherapp-laravel-vue.herokuapp.com/

## **How to get it up and running**
1. Clone the repository
2. Run composer install
3. Run npm install
4. Add your API key to the OPENWEATHER_KEY variable in the .env file.
